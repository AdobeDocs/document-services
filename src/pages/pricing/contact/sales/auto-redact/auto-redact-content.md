## Interested in joining the Beta Program for Adobe PDF Auto-Redact Service?

The Adobe PDF Auto-Redact tool accelerates the redaction of your documents by suggesting potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that you may want to remove from your document.

<TextBlock slots="text" width="100%" theme="lightest"  alignment="yes" paddingTop="5" paddingBottom='5' className="py-0 div-p-0 left-content accessibility-text-blade"/>

You stay in full control by choosing whether the items identified by the AI-powered solution should be redacted, and you can manually add more fields to be redacted.

<TextBlock slots="text" width="100%" theme="lightest"  alignment="yes" paddingTop="5" paddingBottom='5' className="py-0 div-p-0 left-content accessibility-text-blade"/>

Once you are satisfied with which regions of the document need to be redacted, Adobe's secure redaction technology will ensure that the resulting PDF does not contain any trace of the redacted information in the newly created PDF.

<TextBlock slots="text" width="100%" theme="lightest"  alignment="yes" paddingTop="5" paddingBottom='5' className="py-0 div-p-0 left-content accessibility-text-blade"/>
