Adobe PDF Extract API is powered by [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei.html) industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The technology enables a rich understanding of documents, such as the identification of elements, including position and connections relative to other elements. In addition, it can determine reading order. These and other capabilities ensure the most comprehensive output of structured content.

Extracted content is output in a structured JSON file – with tables optionally included as CSV or XLSX files and images saved as PNG files – so developers can easily store, analyze, and manipulate the data in a variety of downstream systems. Examples include databases, systems of record, CRM, ERP, NLP, RPA as well as machine learning models and analytic tools.
