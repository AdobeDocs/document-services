## Account Management

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem header="How do I see how many API transactions or calls I've used?" slot_id="account-management-how-do-i-see-how-many-api-transactions-or-calls-used">

For AWS Marketplace customers, you can login to your AWS account and visit billing dashboard to see your usage: <a href="<https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing>">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing</a>
For Adobe Enterprise Terms Licensing Agreement (ETLA) customers, you will receive monthly emails on your usage.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="My company has an existing Enterprise Agreement with Adobe. Can I use the same Adobe credentials for PDF Services API?" slot_id="account-managment-my-company-has-an-existing-enterprise-agreement-with-adobe">

Your Adobe Admin Console admin may have not provisioned your Enterprise ID to have access to PDF Services APIs. If your organization is a current subscriber to Adobe PDF Services API, contact your administrator.

If you are interested in using Adobe PDF Services API on a trial basis, consider using an Adobe ID (Personal) that is not tied to your enterprise ID.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="Why do I have to use a personal account when setting up a trial or account? Why can't I use my company's existing enterprise email/account?" slot_id="account-management-why-i-do-have-to-use-a-personal-account-when-setting-up-a-trial-or-account">

Access to Adobe Acrobat Services APIs or SDKs is only available when it is attached to an Enterprise Term License Agreement (ETLA) and the organization's IT administrator has provisioned that user to have access to APIs. For this reason, if you are working on a trial basis, it may be easier and faster to use a personal email than your existing Adobe ID.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="Where do I find my Client ID or API key?" slot_id="account-managment-where-do-i-find-my-client-id-or-api-key">

Your Client ID (also known as API key) is unique to your account and provided on the successful trial creation confirmation page. This is the "client_id" key used in the back-end code to make free trial calls against. You can always access your Client ID from your Adobe Developer Console: <a href="<https://console.adobe.io>">https://console.adobe.io</a>

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="How do I use my Adobe Acrobat Services credentials in Microsoft Power Automate, if I initially created them via AWS Marketplace?" slot_id="account-managment-how-do-i-use-my-adobe-acrobate-services-credentials-in-microsoft-power-automate">

For instructions on how to use your Adobe Acrobat Services credentials that were created in AWS Marketplace for use in Power Automate, please reference this step-by-step guide: <a href="<https://helpx.adobe.com/document-cloud/help/pdf-connector-for-microsoft-power-automate.html#pdf-services-with-aws>">https://helpx.adobe.com/document-cloud/help/pdf-connector-for-microsoft-power-automate.html#pdf-services-with-aws</a>

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="If I already have credentials and need new ones, how do I get them?" slot_id="account-managment-if-i-already-have-credentials-and-need-new-ones">

Both paid and trial customers can create new credentials, as well as edit existing credentials, by going to the Admin Console: <a href="<https://developer.adobe.com/console>">https://developer.adobe.com/console</a>

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="Can I continue using my same trial credentials (i.e. keys) when I have paid for Adobe Acrobat Services?" slot_id="account-managment-can-continue-using-my-same-trial-credentials">

You should not use your free trial credentials (Credential Key aka API Key) beyond your free trial.

When you start your Adobe Acrobat Services pay-as-you-go subscription via AWS Marketplace, you will receive new credentials to use for your paid plan. Note that your first 500 transactions or two weeks on the new AWS credential are complimentary--your card will be charged automatically after that. Furthermore, there can only be one active pay-as-you-go credential associated with an account.

In a similar fashion, Enterprise Term Licensing Agreement (ETLA) customers will want to exchange their free trial credentials with the new credentials provided alongside their ETLA plan.

## Billing

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem header="My company has an existing Enterprise Agreement with Adobe. Can I add PDF Services API to that existing agreement?" slot_id="billing-my-company-has-an-existing-emterprise-agreement-with-adobe">

Please contact your account representative to discuss your requirement. There is minimum threshold needs to be met for the Enterprise Agreement with Adobe PDF Services API.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="How will I be billed through AWS?" slot_id="billing-how-will-i-billed-through-aws">

Customers are billed monthly by AWS in arrears for the number of Document Transactions (as defined here: <a href="<https://www.adobe.com/go/aws-docsvs-eula>">https://www.adobe.com/go/aws-docsvs-eula</a>) that have been used in that billing cycle. Specific form of payment can be determined in the AWS console. The number of Document Transactions depends on API calls plus document length for some actions as defined here in our licensing metrics page.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="Is there a way to put a limit on my AWS Pay-As-You-Go usage. How can I ensure that some runaway process (or compromised credentials) are not running up the bill?" slot_id="billing-its-there-a-way-to-put-a-limit-on-my-aws-pay-as-you-go-usage">

Although there isn't a way to place limits for usage, there is an option to set up billing alerts through AWS. See: <a href="<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html>">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html</a>

Adobe ETLAs have a net 30-day payment term.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="If an API action fails, does this count towards our quota?" slot_id="billing-id-an-api-action-fails-does-this-count-towards-our-quota">

No, it will not.

## Ordering

<AccordionItem header="What payment plans does Adobe offer? Which payment plan is right for me?" slot_id="ordering-what-payment-plans-does-adobe-offer">

If you are just starting and have lower volume, or are unsure of what your annual volume will be, pay-as-you-go via AWS Marketplace is a great option, with a 5 cents/document transaction flat fee.

If you have a large annual volume, at least 500,000 document transactions, an Enterprise Term License Agreement will likely be the better plan for you.
