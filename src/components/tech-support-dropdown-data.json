As far as analytics is concerned, PDF Embed only gathers standard anonymous usage and data parameters like locations, timezone, pdf file lang, file name, file size, no of pages, etc. It doesn't store any user-generated content in analytics and never shares user-generated content with Adobe servers.  All server-side components of PDF Services API and PDF Embed API are hosted in the data centers of leading cloud hosting providers.

To mitigate credential exposure in client applications, Acrobat Services API calls should be consumed via a proxy instead of a direct connection to our APIs."
